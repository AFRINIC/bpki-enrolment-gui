# BPKI Enrolment Helper
The aim of this tool is to provide a GUI to user to (1) generate a CSR and private key (2) automatically sends the CSR  the AFRINIC BPKI RA to retrieve the CERTIFICATE.

It's a pretty simple Flask webapp which generates a Certificate Signing Request for creating SSL certificates. Of course, if you are smart, you can run the same thing on command-line.
